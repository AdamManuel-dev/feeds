        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Most programmers spend more time debugging than writing new code, but books and courses on debugging are few and far between, and testing tools to help people figure out if code is buggy or not are much more common than ones to help them figure out where the bugs are. Thankfully, there is a growing body of research on isolating and repairing bugs. One interesting approach is statistical fault localization: given a set of tests that pass and another set that fail, look at the correlation between statements that are executed by failing tests but not by passing tests in...]]></content>
