        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Developers often use APIs to access data or web applications, but misuse of APIs can lead to data loss or software crashes. Although several API misuse detectors exist, most of them suffer from low precision and recall. To address this, Sven2019 proposes MUDETECT, an API misuse detector which builds on the strengths and addresses many of the weaknesses of previous detectors. It has 2X higher recall than previous detectors and 2.5X higher precision; moreover, it can work in cross-project settings and mines patterns across projects rather than from only the target project. MUDETECT begins by encoding API usages as API-Usage...]]></content>
