        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Selecting the best software libraries for a task is a crucial step in programming, but often difficult and confusing because there are gazillions of Q&amp;A websites with conflicting or out-of-date advice. These websites do not provide comprehensive descriptions of libraries' features and usually do not provide comparative data on different libraries. Lopez2018 tackled this problem by implementing and assessing a metric-based comparison of software libraries. They calculated nine software metrics for 34 open-source Java libraries belonging to ten popular domains, such as testing, databases, and cryptography. They then surveyed 61 participants of varied backgrounds to determine how useful the metric-based...]]></content>
