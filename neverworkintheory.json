A dataset! My kingdom for a dataset! The sentiment behind the King Richard's famous cries is perhaps shared, in a different context, by contemporary researchers who have their sights set on developing bug detection or automatic repair systems. Luckily Tomassi2019 have put shovels in the ground and made impressive headway towards a hyper-scale, real-world, current, and reproducible dataset of bugs and their corresponding fixes. The progress takes the form of BugSwarm, a continuous integration (CI) harvesting toolkit that aims to take failed CI pipelines and turn them into data samples. Before BugSwarm, the datasets that were available for...","link":"https://neverworkintheory.org/2021/11/08/my-kingdom-for-a-dataset.html","retrieved":1636566590163}]}
