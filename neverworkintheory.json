Thankfully, there is a growing body of research on isolating and repairing bugs. One interesting approach is statistical fault localization: given a set of tests that pass and another set that fail, look at the correlation between statements that are executed by failing tests but not by passing tests in...","link":"https://neverworkintheory.org/2021/10/31/locating-faults-with-program-slicing.html","retrieved":1635789310245}]}
