These websites do not provide comprehensive descriptions of libraries' features and usually do not provide comparative data on different libraries. Lopez2018 tackled this problem by implementing and assessing a metric-based comparison of software libraries. They calculated nine software metrics for 34 open-source Java libraries belonging to ten popular domains, such as testing, databases, and cryptography. They then surveyed 61 participants of varied backgrounds to determine how useful the metric-based...","link":"https://neverworkintheory.org/2021/11/26/metric-based-comparisons-of-software-libraries.html","retrieved":1637991403059}]}
