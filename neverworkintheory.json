Refactoring is one way programmers do this. Though the idea is simple, it can quickly become a programmer's nightmare, as manual refactoring is tedious and error-prone. Ni2021 introduce an automated refactoring technique called SOAR that combines natural language processing with program synthesis to automatically migrate and refactor between different versions of APIs. It begins by constructing an API matching model based on available documentation for the source and target libraries to find potential replacement calls for each API call in the source program. It then employs program synthesis...","link":"https://neverworkintheory.org/2021/11/18/synthesis-approach-for-data-science-api-refactoring.html","retrieved":1637258543060}]}
